* You can follow series of command to setup Angular environment once you are in your project-name folder:

	a.npm install -> Will install all dependencies -> takes 10 to 15 min

	b.npm run start -> To compile and deploy the project in browser. You can press <Ctrl> key while clicking on localhost:4200 to open project in browser -> takes 2 to 3 min

	c.npm run test -> to run all test cases. It is mandatory to run this command before submission of workspace -> takes 5 to 6 min

* You need to use CTRL+Shift+B - command compulsorily on code IDE, before final submission as well. This will push or save the updated contents in the internal git/repository, and will be used to evaluate the code quality.
